Version 2.0 has been delayed, so I'm releasing version 1.4 with a focus on Android 14 support.

Version 1.4.0 includes:

&bull; Support Android 14
&bull; Upgrade to Flutter 3.19.6
&bull; Upgrade dependencies
&bull; Proper splash screen support (including support for pre-12)
&bull; Tweaks to some features specific to newer Android versions
